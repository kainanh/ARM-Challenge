This is my solution to the ARM Junior Technical Challenge.

I don't have the best knowledge on ORM's and made the mistake of saving the dummy data in js files for this exercise. This proved difficult challenging towards the end of the task with API D as I couldnt update the registered users ratings accordingly to the projects description. I do however have some knowledge on relational databases (mySQL) and upon reflection realise how that would have been a much better way to store the data for this task and complete it in its entirety.
